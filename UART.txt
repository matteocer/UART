UART PROTOCOL

- Both reciever and transmitter work at a 9600 baud rate
- This reciever will only identify that the data is starting
  and identify when the data stops
    - Given that the data stops after 8 bits, it will just
      stop after recieving 8 bits

elements:
IDLE  -> logic level 1
START -> logic level 0
DATA  -> 8 bits of data LSB to MSB
PARITY ----- NOT USED ---------
STOP  -> logic level 1 


States:
IDLE -> wait for start bit (0)
DATA -> data is being sent


Pins:

rx             tx       -NOT USED-
tx             rx
clk            clk
